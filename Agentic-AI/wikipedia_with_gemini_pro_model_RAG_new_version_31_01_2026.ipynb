It does this by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base or external source before generating a response. This allows the model to ground its answers in factual information, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect or nonsensical output.\\n\\nIn essence, when a RAG model receives a query, it first searches a vast corpus of documents (like Wikipedia, research papers, or internal company data) to find information pertinent to the query. This retrieved information is then fed to the language model along with the original query, guiding the model in formulating a more accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant answer. This approach helps overcome some limitations of traditional language models, such as their tendency to \"hallucinate\" or generate plausible-sounding but false information, especially on topics outside their training data.', 'extras': {'signature': 'CuMCAb4+9vtXIbt5Irfot+WMT83ozpmXuNAodT1bNOysoINECuBT0GKgh6MH2IH3m+3sI05OWvHD8n6SxfgowOZSVgQSR99oy5OtOFRNcHf1WUxQYCCWz7zSeCUHNo5q9T+9f2tb2yqcyMvKK9b1tRfz3j1vUmHDXFIBvKEAr+SNXzMwIqjVxl4p1YJI38jqnC9JurSiSEdLC88/9c7yG+CaIr33YjKyjVBigxnVGlK8U3AMUtXTNYSevkqqT8VZ8Xbz8Wkdafq1Z1b5Ra3BSiJf5vCizN7ziXhVBcAjlF2W5a2+mgvnyMbHSJYz6cmim7w16IeIL80+H40WSwlnzT0srtcBKniW224Fft2wOe1VBROx6ZR9XmkfYVd8KPJUELgNcyTnkGtlkKplqXpPVV721kSXUG5vP5RYTOVwQeKlLuh26+czbXrF4MpycWvcyJ2OpArwtkl7lX15tpVArDt3SxmfEw=='}}]\n"
